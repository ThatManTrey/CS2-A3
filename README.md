#CS2-A3
A3 Report - Trey Phillips, 2018

In this assignment, I set up and attempted to complete the bulk of the program at once.
At first, I used the STL stack class and recursion for the print function. In this way,
I minimized programming errors while perfecting the insertion and deletion
functions. I also omitted the count  from the tree node struct and outfile operations.
To randomize the node replacement in the deletion function in the case of there being
two children, I used the current time as a seed.

Once I had these functions finished, I had to clean up syntax that was causing
segmentation errors and add increment and decrement modifiers. Then, I converted the
print function into using the STL stack rather than recursion. Once I got this
algorithm down, I converted my code into using a linked list stack. Finally, I
utilized the outfile, continuing to test different cases until anything I thought of
couldn't cause errors.
